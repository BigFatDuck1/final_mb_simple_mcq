        "explanation": "- lung metastasis Glioblastoma multiforme is known for its infiltrative nature, meaning it tends to invade surrounding brain tissue rather than forming a well-defined border. This is a true characteristic of GBM. Glioblastomas are primarily brain tumors and do not typically metastasize to distant organs like the lungs. While they can spread locally within the central nervous system, systemic metastasis is rare. This statement is false regarding GBM. GBM can spread within the brain and can affect the contralateral hemisphere, especially through the white matter tracts. This is a true characteristic. Glioblastomas can spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may lead to leptomeningeal dissemination, which is a recognized pattern of spread for this tumor type. This statement is true. _",
